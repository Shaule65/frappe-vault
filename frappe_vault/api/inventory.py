"""Picking Linux hosts from the Inventory Management app's VM records.

Soft integration, deliberately: `inventory_management` is a separate app that
may or may not be installed on any given site running `frappe_vault`. Nothing
here imports from it directly — every function checks the doctype exists
before touching it, and returns a "not available" answer rather than raising
when it doesn't, so a site without inventory_management sees an ordinary Vault
with no picker, not a broken one.

Permissions are the other half of that carefulness: this never elevates
access. A user who cannot read `Virtual Machines` in the desk gets the same
answer here — none of the API below uses `ignore_permissions`. Inventory
Management's own role model (System Manager / Inventory Manager / Inventory
Operator / Inventory Viewer) decides who sees anything, same as it always did;
being a Vault User grants nothing extra.
